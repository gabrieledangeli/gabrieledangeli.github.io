HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. 

It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive.

At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
