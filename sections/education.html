        <p>
            I was born on February 20, 2000, in San Benedetto del Tronto, a coastal city in Italy, where I grew up and
            lived until I was 18.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started elementary school at just five years old, a year earlier than usual, at my parents' wish so that I
            could attend the same school as my sister.
            <br>
            After five years, I moved on to middle school and then to the science high school in my hometown, where my
            passion for physics and mathematics blossomed.
        </p>

        <p>
            At 18, I left home to move to Milan and study Computer Engineering at the Politecnico. During the pandemic, I
            went through challenging times when loneliness and the lack of social interaction began to weigh on me.
            During those periods, I felt unmotivated and realized that I needed to focus on getting to know myself as
            well as on my studies.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2021, I graduated and decided to continue for another year at the Politecnico, concentrating on Artificial
            Intelligence. However, I was unsure whether to stay in Milan or try an experience abroad. So, as I worked to
            clarify my goals, I applied to EPFL.
