        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            <span>Hi!</spap> My name is <strong>Gabriele D'Angeli</strong>. I am <strong>24 years old</strong> and come
            from San Benedetto del Tronto, a picturesque town nestled on the Adriatic coast in central Italy. I grew up and lived there until I turned 18, at
            which point I moved to Milan to study <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at the <strong>Politecnico di Milano.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            After graduating in 2021, I chose to continue my studies at the Politecnico in the field of
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> within the Computer Engineering Master, where I deepened my knowledge in core AI disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2022, I joined the <strong>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</strong> in Switzerland,
            enrolling in their Master’s program in <strong>Quantum Science and Engineering</strong> This program offered the perfect
            blend of my two main interests: <strong>physics</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            During my year and a half in Lausanne, I honed my skills in <strong>Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data
            Science, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Information Processing</strong>, along with other fields
            like <strong>Classical and Quantum Cryptography.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I then moved to <strong>Zurich </strong> for a <strong>six-month internship</strong> with
            <strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</strong>, where I gained practical experience in <strong>High-Performance Computing (HPC)</strong> and <strong>hybrid classical-quantum
            algorithms.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am in Geneva, writing my master’s thesis at <strong>CERN.</strong> My thesis project
            centers on <strong>Quantum Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Tensor Networks</strong>, specifically focusing on encoding classical
            data for <strong>Quantum Machine Learning</strong> algorithms to enhance their performance and accuracy.
