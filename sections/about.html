        <p>
            I have always been fascinated by understanding how things work: once I understood the importance of my
            sensitivity, I dedicated myself to analyzing my feelings, trying to understand their causes, from the most
            superficial to the deepest ones. I wanted to live in harmony, and even today, this quest represents my
            greatest inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            During those same years, while studying, I was learning how things work. What I loved about science was its
            elegance, its rigorous method, and the illusion it offered of being able to control nature. I wanted to
            combine what I was learning to weave a unique tale of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In art, I see a perfect synthesis between the search for answers and the celebration of questions: to my
            eyes, it seems to unite the spiritual and the scientific.
